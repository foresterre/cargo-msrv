### Usage

<sup>‚åò [preview](#preview) - [prerequisites](#prerequisites) - [install](#install) - [usage](#usage) - [JSON output format](#json-format) - [a short history](#a-short-history) - [license](#license)</sup>

* [`cargo msrv find`](https://foresterre.github.io/cargo-msrv/commands/find.html)
  or [`cargo msrv find --linear`](https://foresterre.github.io/cargo-msrv/commands/find.html) to find the MSRV for a
  Cargo project in your current working directory.
* [`cargo msrv --path <dir> find`](https://foresterre.github.io/cargo-msrv/commands/find.html) to find the MSRV for a
  Cargo project in the `<dir>` directory.
* [`cargo msrv find -- <command>`](https://foresterre.github.io/cargo-msrv/commands/find.html) to use `<command>` as the
  compatibility check which decides whether a Rust version is
  compatible or not. This command should be runnable through rustup as `rustup run <toolchain> <command>`.
    * Example: `cargo msrv find -- cargo check --tests`.
    * Example: `cargo msrv find -- cargo check --ignore-rust-version`. Only available on Rust >= 1.56.
* [`cargo msrv verify`](https://foresterre.github.io/cargo-msrv/commands/verify.html)  to verify the MSRV as specified
  by a crate author\
    * A crate author may specify the MSRV using the `package.rust-version` (Rust >=1.56) or the `package.metadata.msrv`
      key in the 'Cargo.toml' manifest. See
      the [book](https://foresterre.github.io/cargo-msrv/commands/list.html#description) for a more detailed
      description.
* [`cargo msrv list`](https://foresterre.github.io/cargo-msrv/commands/list.html) to list the MSRV's of your
  dependencies as specified by their authors
* [`cargo msrv show`](https://foresterre.github.io/cargo-msrv/commands/show.html) to show the currently specified MSRV

Please refer to the [commands](https://foresterre.github.io/cargo-msrv/commands/index.html) chapter in the cargo-msrv
book for more detailed descriptions of the supported (sub) commands.

      --no-user-output
          Disable user output

Debug output options:
      --no-log
          Disable logging

      --log-target <LOG TARGET>
          Specify where the program should output its logs

          [default: file]
          [possible values: file, stdout]

      --log-level <LEVEL>
          Specify the severity of logs which should be

          [default: info]
          [possible values: trace, debug, info, warn, error]


            You may provide a custom compatibility `check` command as the last argument (only
            when this argument is provided via the double dash syntax, e.g. `$ cargo msrv -- custom
            command`.
            This custom check command will then be used to validate whether a Rust version is
            compatible.
            A custom `check` command should be runnable by rustup, as they will be passed on to
            rustup like so: `rustup run <toolchain> <COMMAND...>`. NB: You only need to provide the
            <COMMAND...> part.

            By default, the custom check command is `cargo check`.

### JSON format

<sup>‚åò [preview](#preview) - [prerequisites](#prerequisites) - [install](#install) - [usage](#usage) - [JSON output format](#json-format) - [a short history](#a-short-history) - [license](#license)</sup>

JSON output may be enabled by providing the `--output-format json` flag: `cargo msrv find --output-format json`.
Events are printed as json lines. The event type is indicated by the `type` key.

Please see the [Output formats](https://foresterre.github.io/cargo-msrv/output-formats/index.html) and
[Output format: JSON](https://foresterre.github.io/cargo-msrv/output-formats/json.html) chapters of the
book for documentation of this output format.

_An [excerpt](https://foresterre.github.io/posts/puzzle-sharing-declarative-args-between-top-level-and-subcommand/)_

> `cargo-msrv` was originally born out of a desire to find the MSRV for a Rust project (more specifically package). MSRV
> stands for "minimal supported Rust version" and is the earliest or oldest version supported by a Rust project. For
> different projects this may mean different things, but for this post I will consider "support" as "does compile with a
> Rust toolchain of a certain version".
>
> Fast forward a few years, and the MSRV has become somewhat more ubiquitous which can also be seen by its inclusion
> into Cargo as the [rust-version](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-rust-version-field). Over
> time some additional tools were added to `cargo-msrv`. One of these was the `cargo msrv verify` subcommand.
>
> This subcommand can be used to check whether a Rust project supports its defined MSRV (e.g. via this `rust-version`
> field in the Cargo manifest). For example, in a CI pipeline you can use this to check whether your project works for
> the
> version you promised to your users.
>
> Originally, I kept the `cargo msrv` top level command aside from the subcommands for backwards compatibility reasons.
> In hindsight I probably shouldn't have done that, but as is, their coexistence at least provides me with the
> opportunity
> to write this blog post üòÖ.
>
> **How cargo msrv works**
>
>I described the "support" from "minimal supported Rust version" (MSRV) above as the somewhat simplified "does compile
> with a Rust toolchain of a certain version".
>
>You may write that as a function like so:  `fn is_compatible(version) -> bool`. If you run this test for some Rust
> version, when the function produces the value `true`, then we consider the Rust version to be supported. If instead
> the
> function produces the value `false`, then the Rust version is not supported.
>
>`cargo msrv` specifically searches for the _minimal_ Rust version which is supported by a given Rust project. While
> there are some caveats, we build upon
> Rust's [stability promise](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/10/30/Stability.html#committing-to-stability) . In our case
> that is the idea that Rust versions are backwards compatible.
>
>For a simple example to determine an MSRV, you can linearly walk backwards from the most recent Rust version to the
> earliest. When your project doesn't compile for a specific Rust version, then the last version that did compile can be
> considered your MSRV.
>
>Let's make it a bit more concrete with an example. For this example, we assume that Rust the following Rust versions
> exist: `1.0.0` up to and including `1.5.0`.
>
>Consider a project which uses the [Duration](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Duration.html#) API which was
> stabilised by [Rust 1.3.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-130-2015-09-17) (and
> nothing more recent üòâ).
>
>Then, if you would compile this project with Rust version from most recent to least recent, you would expect the
> following to happen:
>
>- `is_compatible(Rust 1.5.0)` returns `true` ‚úÖ
>- `is_compatible(Rust 1.4.0)` returns `true` ‚úÖ
>- `is_compatible(Rust 1.3.0)` returns `true` ‚úÖ
>- `is_compatible(Rust 1.2.0)` returns `false` ‚ùå ("Duration is not stable")
>- `is_compatible(Rust 1.1.0)` returns `false` ‚ùå
>- `is_compatible(Rust 1.0.0)` returns `false` ‚ùå
>
>Since we only care about the _minimal_ Rust version, you could have stopped searching after compiling Rust 1.2.0; Rust
> 1.3.0 was the earliest released Rust version which worked.
>
>In reality doing a linear search is quite slow (at the time of writing, there are 79 minor versions), so we primarily
> use a binary search instead to incrementally reduce the search space.
>
>`cargo msrv verify` works quite similar to "finding the MSRV", but instead of running a search which produces as
> primary output the MSRV, in this case the MSRV is already known in advance. So given a `MSRV` of `1.3.0` we just run
> the
`is_compatible(Rust 1.3.0)` function once. If it returns `true` we can say that the 1.3.0 is an acceptable MSRV (
> although not necessarily strictly so). More importantly, if it returns false, then the specified version is actually
> not
> supported, and thus can not be an MSRV).
