# Changelog

This is the changelog for [cargo-msrv](https://github.com/foresterre/cargo-msrv), a tool and cargo plugin, which can be
used to find the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of your projects.
This changelog is aimed at users, and only contains user-relevant changes.

If you found an issue, have a suggestion or want to provide feedback or insights, please feel free to open an issue on
the [issue tracker](https://github.com/foresterre/cargo-msrv/issues), or open a topic in the [discussions section](https://github.com/foresterre/cargo-msrv/discussions).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

* Subcommand `cargo msrv verify` now supports setting a custom Rust version via the `--rust-version <VERSION>` argument, 
  which can be used to check for a crate's compatibility against a specific Rust version. 
* Added flag `--write-msrv` to cargo msrv (find), which upon finding the MSRV writes its value to the Cargo manifest.
* Added option to refer to a specific crate using its Cargo manifest (with `--manifest-path`) instead of its path (with `--path`)
* Added a 'minimal' output option intended for machine-readable use when full json output is undesirable.

### Changed

* CLI options are now grouped.
* Option `--min <version>` now also accepts two component semver `major.minor` versions, in addition to full three component (strict) SemVer versions, and edition specifiers like "2015", "2018" and "2021".
* Option `--max <version>` now also accepts two component semver `major.minor` versions, in addition to full three component (strict) SemVer versions.
* The rust-releases index is now only fetched for subcommands which depend on it.
* Renamed `--toolchain-file` to `--write-toolchain-file` to emphasise that the toolchain-file is an output.
* Subcommand `cargo msrv set` will now default to writing a regular TOML table for the metadata MSRV fallback value, instead of an inline table.
* The rust-toolchain file will now be overwritten if a rust-toolchain file was already present.
* Updated user output formatting to be more consistent between output formats.
* `cargo-msrv` now requires paths to be UTF-8.
* `--write-msrv` now writes two, instead of three component version numbers .


#### Infra

* Changed release artifact name of `cargo-msrv` packages on Github, such that they can be installed with `cargo-binstall` out of the box.

### Fixed

* Subcommand `cargo msrv set` will now return an error when the Cargo manifest solely consists of a virtual workspace.
* The program will no longer return an unformatted message when a command failed and the output format was set to json.
* Fix issue where reading the fallback MSRV from a TOML inline table was not possible.
* Fix an index out-of-bounds panic which occurred if the filtered Rust releases search space was empty

### Removed

* Removed deprecated option `cargo msrv --verify`. Use `cargo msrv verify` instead.
* Removed option to disable reading the Rust edition in from the Cargo manifest with `--no-read-min-edition`, which limited the search space.

[Unreleased]: https://github.com/foresterre/cargo-msrv/compare/v0.15.1...HEAD

## [0.15.1] - 2022-02-24

In this release a license generation step was fixed, which caused the automated binary builds to fail.
In addition, a Cargo feature toggle was added which adds a feature gate for the rust-dist release source of
the rust-releases crate. This allows people who build from source to build cargo-msrv without the default
features (i.e. without rust-dist), which reduces build time and binary size.

This release does not contain user-facing changes, hence the lack of changelog entries for this version.

[0.15.1]: https://github.com/foresterre/cargo-msrv/compare/v0.15.0...v0.15.1

## [0.15.0] - 2022-02-23

### Added

* Flag `--no-user-output` which disables user output.
* Subcommand `cargo msrv set`, which can be used to write a given MSRV to the Cargo manifest.

### Changed

* ⚠️ Breaking change: Changed default cargo-msrv (find) check command from `cargo check --all` to `cargo check`.
  * Revert to the old behaviour by running cargo-msrv with a custom check command: `cargo msrv -- cargo check --all`.

### Removed

* ⚠️ Breaking change: Value `void` was removed as a valid format for the `--output-format` option.

* You can now also simply run cargo-msrv standalone, i.e. `cargo-msrv` instead of `cargo msrv`.

_Only list available as a subcommand. The determine-msrv and verify-msrv commands have not been ported to subcommands yet,
but are planned to._
